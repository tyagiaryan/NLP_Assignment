Implement the following in Python:
Co-occurrence matrix(count-based vectors)

a. Plot co-occurrence word embeddings

b. Write a method to work out the distinct words (word types) that occur in the corpus.

c. Write a method that constructs a co-occurrence matrix for a certain window-size n (with a default of 4), considering words n before and n after the word in the center of the window ( numpy library will be useful for vector, matrix, etc)

d. Construct a method that performs dimensionality reduction on the matrix to produce k-dimensional embeddings

e.  write a function to plot a set of 2D vectors in 2D space.
